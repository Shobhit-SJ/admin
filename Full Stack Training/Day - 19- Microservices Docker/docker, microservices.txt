How do we create a microservices application?

1. We need docker to installed an  running.   (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
2, we need to kmow the commands
        
             docker --version
             docker images (show me the list of images on docker)
             docker ps (show me the list of containers running)
             docker build . (create a docker image of the application)
             docker pull(nikhilshahdocker/imageName) 
             docker push(nikhilshahdocker/imageName) push to repository
             docker run -d -p 4455:8080 ourshoppinglist/our-shopping-list (name of the images) 

-d means --->docker demon (docker environment)  -p   -->(portnumber)



             docker stop name of the container (when  u run docker ps, the last column is the name of the container, it is a randon name)

             this will just stop the container, to be accessed so you will not be able
             to access it contaioner is still present in the memory

             docker rm containerid (this will remove the docker container and free the memory) or do docker rm --force contanierid
             docker -rmi imageid of you want to delete the docker image from your machine



------------------------------------------------------
1. installed docker extension
2. create a new .net project (any project in any technology, language)
      
       dotnet new mvc --name firstmicroservice_shobhit     (command in vs code to make mvc)

3.
create your own image




to add in dockerhub:


docker tag firstmicroservice_shobhit:aqua shobhitjais/firstmicroservice_shobhit:aqua   (username/buildFilename)

docker push shobhitjais/firstmicroservice_shobhit:aqua
