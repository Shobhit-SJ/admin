									Cloud Introduction

		Azure cloud fundamentals (40% of cloud - 60% of azure cloud) - AZ900

A cloud is a place where u can find all the IT services eg. VM(compute), Databases, IOT, AI, ML, Data Services, Networks, Security 200+ such services.

some major providers -	Microsoft
		-	Amazon
		-	Google
		- 	IBM
		-	HP
		-	Oracle

Types of cloud: public - Available to public via subscriptions (Credit card),
		private - Dedicated hw/service Available only to organization,
 		Hybrid - mix of both
		Community - Shared only by community members. Only available to community like banks, insurance, travel etc..


types of cloud services: SAAS - Software as a service- buy the software service like software for dataanalystics,IOT operations,
					 AI,ML,Compute programming Functions app, Logic app event grid etc..,
			 PAAS - Run your software on their hardware. services like App services,
			 IAAS




Azure fundamentals wil cover here. it provide 200+ services some are here.

VM(compute)


SQL server (PAAS and SAAS)   
		steps: first search sql -> select sql server -> give server name -> change Authentication method to Use SQL authentication
			 then given Server admin login and password
		search for networking -> change public network to enable -> down side u will get checkbox just click then save 
		 now open sql server use all creditentail use the username, servername, password  which u have given in the vm 
			and authentication to sql server authentication. start working with sql server

	sql- create server- gives u more control (SAAS) - extra cost
	sql - dstsbase - less costly - less control 



Storage service 
	Storage Account (consider this as a harddrive) it has 4 sub services
		a. Containers - like a drive- which can have many folders sub folders and then files in it (eg img or pdf file, video file)
		b. Drive - this is like a shared folder over internet.
		c. table -  a single table - mix of sql NoSQL
		d. blob - large objects - used for backups (10Gb to 100TB files) store it at a very cheap rate.
	2 categories of storage services
			a. Hot storage (for frequently used data) - high performance - where data can be access multiple times in a day continuous usage.
			b. Cold storage (for old data -less data) - low cost eg. 10 years old data-which is used to store data and access like yearly once.
							insurance company can use combination of both.

	Storage ACC V1 and v2
			V1 - just store the data and access it.
			V2 - also called as datalake
                                for all the data, stored
                         json, xml file, excel file, images, videos, etc...

                         service will read the data(content) and metadata from files

                         and create an index for faster searching

                            (costlier than v1)


container in blob azure is just like our c drive d drive e drive in our my computer..

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



                             admin will create a storage service on portal
 
                         and users , will use connect the service with a tool called azure storage explorer.

CosmoDB (NO SQL database - mongoDB)



               cosmodb - service
this is a blanket service of open setvice platform consiting of
   Mongo DB
   GraphQL
   pOSTGres- combination of sql and no sql
   tablue

------------------------------------------------
SQL               NoSql
SQL SERVER        MongoDB
Table             Collection
rows/ column      document
sql queries       javascript functions






APP Services (hosting web contents) - WEBAPI, rest, ASP.net mvc, Angular, mobile.
ACR(azure container registery) - host ur images here
AKS (azure kubernetes services) prod env for images
Logic App -  UI based business login app - used in most of the projects



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***************************************   Azure Devops ****************************************************


1.Create Pipelines
       
           CI - continuous integration - integrate new changes in the previous build
           CD - continuous Deployment - integrate new changes in production (pick up from CI)



2. Configure Agile Methodology for dvelopers,
              which will now also include operations, clients, user





-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Virtual Machine::
		Resource Groups: OS
				RAM
				Network
				Firewall

to create any service in azure, u need resource group.
resource group: this is a handle for mutiple resource clubbing under 1 roof u apply security on RG it gets applied on all the resource under it.
Region - (location of data center) where do u want to host ur resources.


Create a first reource - VM 

ways to create 	1: By using azure portal - i need to have portal username and password
		2: run scripts (powershell scripts)
			open command prompt
			az login
		3: If we want to create multiple machines (20 machines)\
			ARM templates in a loop
			Azure Resource Manger templates(JSON based files)
		4: Devops for 2 and 3
