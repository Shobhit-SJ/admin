    Angular is used for creating SPA


single paged application

when users connects for the first time to server, server will send a single page (index.html)
which will contain all the other pages (cpmponents)
--by deafult - display app.component,html to user
--app.component.html will have links to other components


Home | About | Contact | History | Carrees | Login


--users clicks on any of the link, UI will change on screen, but all the content will come within the browser
and user does not go to server, as everything is included in index.html

--user will go to server only when new data is needed (CRUD operation with REST API)
--application will work even work even when user is disconnected
